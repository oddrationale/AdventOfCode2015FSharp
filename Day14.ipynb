On the eleventh second, Comet begins resting (staying at 140 km), and Dancer continues on for a total distance of 176 km.  On the 12th second, both reindeer are resting.  They continue to rest until the 138th second, when Comet flies for another ten seconds.  On the 174th second, Dancer flies for another 11 seconds.</p>\n",
